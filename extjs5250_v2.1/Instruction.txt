REQUIREMENTS :

	Java EE 1.7 
	JEE7 server like WildFly 8
	
INSTRUCTION :	

1. Set AS4/00 ip address and port in Configuration file 5250_5250.properties.
2. Copy 5250_5250.properties to user home directory
   For example
   if it is windows 7 -> copy to C:\Users\CURRENT_WINDOWS_USER_NAME
   if it is unix -> /home/USER
           where USER is user under which web server is running

3. copy 5250.war file to java web server

4. with browser open url http://YOUR_WEB_SERVER:PORT/extjs5250


NOTE: to test sending responses from server at any time (websocket channel) use this command

   QSYS/SNDBRKMSG MSG(TEST MESSAGE) TOMSGQ(QPADEV****) MSGTYPE(*INQ) RPYMSGQ(QUSER)

   Where QPADEV**** is device of your web session

   
TODO :
  more config options like displayName support, language setup...
  
ISSUES: 
  Only issue is tn5250j old connection mechanism - thread based connections. 
  This is limitation for having many tn5250 sessions, best option would be to switch to event based communication.
