REQUIREMENTS :

	Java EE 1.7 
	JEE7 server like WildFly 8
	
INSTRUCTION :	

1. Set AS4/00 ip address and port in Configuration file 5250_5250.properties.
2. Copy 5250_5250.properties to user home directory
   For example
   if it is windows 7 -> copy to C:\Users\CURRENT_WINDOWS_USER_NAME
   if it is unix -> /home/USER
           where USER is user under which web server is running

3. copy 5250.war file to java web server

4. with browser open url http://YOUR_WEB_SERVER:PORT/extjs5250


NOTE: to test sending responses from server at any time (websocket channel) use this command

   QSYS/SNDBRKMSG MSG(TEST MESSAGE) TOMSGQ(QPADEV****) MSGTYPE(*INQ) RPYMSGQ(QUSER)

   Where QPADEV**** is device of your web session

   
TODO :
  more config options like displayName support, language setup...
  
ISSUES: 
  Only issue is tn5250j old connection mechanism - thread based connections. 
  This is limitation for having many tn5250 sessions, best option would be to switch to event based communication.
   
NOTE:
 Tn3812 printer written based on RFC 2887 specification - http://tools.ietf.org/pdf/rfc2887
 SCS printer data stream processing written based on document IBM IPDS & SCS Technical Reference (S544-5312-07)      
 
 ***** SOURCE FOLDER DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 **src **
 directory contains all needed logic for web rest services to enable remote commands for 5250/3812 session management  
 
 **src_base **
 directory with websocket implementation specifically customised for ExtJS framework 
 
 **src_tn3812 ** 
 directory is a tn3812 telnet client implementation with drivers mechanizm. 
 To active session we can register multiple drivers so for one data, multiple processing engines can be used simultaneously.
 For example, we want to stream raw data, but also to generate pdf document with another driver.
 
 Drivers are listeners for printer session data retrieval. Each driver can register data processing listener depending on
 data type processor. So in the future, we could easily implement IPDS data parser.
 
 Processor listeners have various method to be called while data stream is processed. For new line, page print, style change etc...
 Available processors listeners are pdf generator, console otuptut and raw data writer.
